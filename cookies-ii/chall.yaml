  My favorite snack is cookies, but I'll only reveal my secret recipe [the flag] to the right person.
  This time I [en]coded the cookies myself, so only the website admin can figure out what they really are. 
hints:
  - Do you know what a base conversion is?
  - Have you heard of the base64 encoding?
