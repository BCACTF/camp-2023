description: |-
  My friend sent this game to me, but he said the code isn't quite finished yet.
  He also said to be careful because â€œThe cardinality of one of the buffer constructs is delimited 
  by a determinate measure." and "not to exceed the moral constructs of the space in this world 
  thou hath been given". I don't really know what that means, but maybe you'll enjoy the game.
hints:
  - Have you heard of a buffer overflow?
