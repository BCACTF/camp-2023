  My friend sent this game to me, but he said the code isn't quite finished yet.
  He also said to be careful because one of the buffers has a limited size,
  and not to go over it. I don't really know what that means, but maybe you'll enjoy the game.
hints:
  - Have you heard of a buffer overflow?
