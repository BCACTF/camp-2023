description: |-
  My friend sent this game to me, but he said the code isn't quite finished yet.
  He also said to be careful because of limited memory and stuff, but I know I
  can just download more RAM. Can you beat the game?
hints:
  - What marks the end of a string?
  - Have you heard of a buffer overflow?
