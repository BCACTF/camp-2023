## CSCamp 2023 Problems

- Remember to create a new branch
- Copy the format of `chall.yaml` from `example/`
- Don't worry about hosting things for now
- Don't commit stuff like `node_modules`, compiled binaries, etc.

- Include a solvepath
- Send a PR and tag an admin for review
- Look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information
