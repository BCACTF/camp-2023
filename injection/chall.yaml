  I feel like my doctor is hiding something in his database, but his web portal keeps telling me 
  I'm not authorized to find out. He told me only admins are allowed to see the data, but it *is*
  my data, so I should be able to see it, right?
hints:
  - Do you know what language is used to query databases?
  - Read up on injection attacks.
