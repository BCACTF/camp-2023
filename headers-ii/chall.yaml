  My friends are passing even weirder files within the group chat now. 
  I have no clue what they're trying to hide this time.
hints:
  - There's no file extension, but what other way could I figure out what type of file it is?
  - Someone told me there might be multiple files (even though they only sent one)
files:
  - src: funnyfile
